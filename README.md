## Style guide for Python

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), standard is followed by open source communities.

## TeamForge to GitHub migration

In this project we have maintained PEP 8 standard.

## Tools written during the project

1. SVN type repository to Git repository by converting SVN features to Git features like trunk, tags, branches revisions.
2. Git repository (which was present in TeamForge) to Git (GitHub).

## New concepts in Migration project

1. [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage) for file size more than 50 MB
2. Executing bash script from Python script.
3. Components of SVN repository, how to convert those into Git components.

## Libraries used in Migration project

1. [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
2. [GitPython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html)
3. [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)

## Resources to learn ðŸ“š

1. [Python's official site (Recommended)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
2. [Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs)

## IDE

#### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Recommended extensions

1. [Python (Microsoft)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
2. [Python Indent](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KevinRose.vsc-python-indent)
3. [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv)
4. [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

#### [PyCharm - Community Edition (Recommended)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

PyCharm is a full-fledged IDE which comes with almost everything common which are needed for coding in Python.

Configure the virtual environment path in PyCharm which enables running scripts within the IDE.
